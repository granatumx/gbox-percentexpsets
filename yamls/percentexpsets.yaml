  title: Percentage differential expression sets {VER}
  subtitle: Reduce grouped data and transpose to determine genes of interest
  description: >
    If we have labeled or clustered the assay of cells, we can create statistics of each
    group of cells for each gene such as examining if a gene is expressed in an ON state
    x% more in one group than another group. We can then create a feature vector for each gene. 
    Genes with similar expression behavior will be grouped together on a downstream analysis such as UMAP plotting. 
    It will create an array with columns for the cluster comparisons and rows for each gene.
    Each element will represent the increased or decreased percentage of cells turned on 
    for that gene in the first group compared to the second group. It is expected that the
    cells would follow a bimodal distribution if they do not have 100% or 0% expressed.
    If both sets are found to have a unimodal distribution (within our certainty), then
    we need to check if one set is fully ON and the other set is fully OFF within our certainty.
    If it is so, then the comparison will return either -100% or 100% depending on the result.
    If one set is found to have a unimodal distribution (within our certainty)
